Hi my name is **Sanchit Asoliya** and this is my digital garden/PKM/second brain/blog, or whatever word/way you want to name it, a place where i share with you my ideas, projects, thoughts/opinions, reflections and knowledge. The sole purpose of building this site is to document the important things/things i deeply care about and a step towards building 
in public.

Although it is not a website per se, i may still sometime refer or call it a "website" unintentionally so you know what to constitute as the meaning whenever i use the word website. Unlike a traditional blog, a "digital garden" has no chronological order, or same flow throughout, rather it has no order, structure, or linearity, it often includes unfinished, unpolished, and informal ideas that are still growing and sometimes ever-growing and evolving ideas.

begin with tags below are some of the tags and meanings which they imply:


> [!NOTE] Tags and their meanings
> One of the important things which separates a digital garden from a website is the transparency and disclosure they put out, in a digital garden we define the stages of a post using tags such as:
> 1. [Seedling](https://sanchitasoliya.xyz/tags/seedlings): It refers to the early ideas, which are still in their brainstorming and drafting phase.
> 2. [Budding](https://sanchitasoliya.xyz/tags/budding): This implies that the content is in useable format, but improvements can still be made.
> 3. [Matured](https://sanchitasoliya.xyz/tags/matured): And finally this tag refers to content which is reliable and has rarely any room for further improvements.


Currently, I'm building a personal system that would store all my learnings at a single place (a PKM) and a system which works as a wiki to all my notes & systems, and interconnect 
them so i have a better access to them whenever i need them irrespective of the device i use, where i use, and how i use (with or without the internet). I'm also exploring the tools which 
i will use for my personal, academic, and creative pursuits. 


> [!info]- More about me
> Continuing from my name, in terms of academics, i've done bachelors in commerce, and i'm currently pursuing Company secretary from ICSI (right now in the professional level). My 
day starts with watching online lectures and ends on reading corporate laws and regulations. And in terms of my personal and creative aspirations i like reading books, venting my 
thoughts on paper, doing whatever nerdy technical stuff i think useful even if it amounts to nothing in the end, and i'm a proud early adopter to new tech advancements and tools, and if i talk about my future although i do not think of it as much these days, i would like to work on projects that have deeper impact on society (be it my own project or of someone else's) including open source projects (FLOSS), i'd like to see myself working towards different pursuits and not be attached to any single niche. I also want to work in a field which has a balance of complexity and some creative element to it. Although i'm nowhere close to any of it as of right now, but that's the ideal environment i want myself to be a part of.
